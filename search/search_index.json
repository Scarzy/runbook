[15 mins] Lay the carpet by applying strips of NEC double sided tape to the floor and roll the carpet out onto it in sections. [1 hour] The following steps can be carried out in parallel. Two people work on each step. Mark out where the arena walls will be laid on the carpet with insulating tape. [15 mins] Fill the jerrycans with water. [15 mins] Place the arena walls onto the carpet. The wall sections are number and must be placed in the correct order so that the screw holes line up. [30 mins] Screw the wall sections together. [30 mins] Place the jerrycans on the wall feet. [15 mins] Mark out where the arena wall markers are to be stuck with insulating tape on the carpet next to the wall face. [15 mins] Apply the markers to the walls using a cross of double-sided tape and surround the edges with white gaffer tape. Take care to ensure the ordering and arena assignment (A/B) is correct. [30 mins] Mark out the corners with the fluorescent gaffer tape and write the corner number on the carpet with the tape. [15 mins] Apply the A/B markers to the outside of the arena walls. [15 mins] Place the crowd-control barrier around the arenas. [15 mins] Total construction time: 4 hours 15 mins. SR2016 Game (Sunny Side Up) Specific Set-up Plan \u00b6 The SR2016 game requires tokens to be constructed. These tokens consist of cardboard box cubes with 250mm side-length covered with libkoki markers. To assist human spectators, coloured gaffer tape is applied to the faces of the cube. Four people are required for token construction Materials \u00b6 Cardboard boxes - 36x 9\"x9\"x9\" double-wall boxes (external dimensions approx. 245mm x 254mm x 254mm) Token libkoki markers Double-sided finger-lift tape - 4x 12mm x 50m rolls White cloth gaffer tape - 6x 24mm x 25m rolls Grey cloth gaffer tape - 3x 24mm x 25m rolls Fluorescent cloth gaffer tape - 12x 24mm x 25m rolls three each of yellow, green, orange and pink Tools \u00b6 Laptop running the token verification software Procedure \u00b6 There are two sets of tokens to be built. Those for arena A and those for arena B. It is extremely important that the markers for these are kept separate throughout the build process. To help with this the tokens are to be built in two batches - first those for arena A then those for arena B. To complicate matters further there are three different token nets per arena so always triple check that you have the right markers. Fold the flat-packed box into a cube. [30 sec] Use the grey tape to seal the top and bottom flaps along the seam. [30 sec] Obtain a complete set of markers (top, bottom, sides 0 through 3) all for the same arena and net (A, B or C). [30 sec] Apply a cross of double-sided tape to a side of the box. Stick the correct marker onto the box, taking care to align it in the centre of the face. Also take care to ensure that the orientation is correct relative to the other markers on the box. Repeat the above two steps until all of the markers have been stuck on the box. [10 mins] Verify the token with the verification program on the laptop, following the instructions next to the laptop. If the verification program indicates the token is correct continue, otherwise fix the problem. [1 min] Use the grey tape (use white tape if the grey has run out) to cover all 12 edges of the box and seal the marker edges. [2 mins] Apply coloured gaffer tape to each side of the box, surrounding the marker. Take care to ensure that it is outside of the grey square surrounding each marker. See the marker construction cheat-sheet for the side to colour mapping. [5 mins] Apply white gaffer tape to the top and bottom of the box, surrounding the marker. Again, take care to ensure that it is outside of the grey square. [2 mins] Verify the token with the verification program again. [1 min] Repeat. Setup time: 30 mins . Construction time per token: ~23mins .

Add a second screwdriver to the equipment, to allow two people to be assembly simultaneously. Provide both PZ2 and PZ1 screwdrivers. Only a PZ2 screwdriver was provided in SR2017 and some of the screws turned out to have PZ1 heads. Address labels were not required as the RPi name and last few MAC octets were written on the cardboard sled. The RPis have been left on their sleds, so are ready to deploy immediately. The display mounts always have missing/incorrect screws, so make sure that we have spares available in the materials. According to the VESA FDMI spec for 75x75 and 100x100 mounts, we need M4x10mm screws (ideally with PZ2 pan head). When assembling the unicol stands, make sure that the three holes in the poles are at the top on the stands for the large displays and on the bottom for the small displays. Ensure that the pole mounts for the small screens are mounted in the orientation that allows the screen to be pivoted side-to-side, rather than up/down. This stops them from drooping during the competition. For the mounts that we have used previously, this is achieved by orienting the bracket on the monitor as an 'I' rather than an 'H'. Some of the SR screens may be missing IEC mains leads.

Libkoki Markers \u00b6 The arena marker requirements are identical to SR2016. The arena markers from SR2016 will be reused for SR2017. As a note for future purchases, it would be useful if the arena markers had a v-notch in the centre of their bottom edge to aid with alignment during arena construction. Requirements (all ranges inclusive): Type Size Arena A Arena B Notes Arena 250mm 100-127 150-177 We have all of the markers used in SR2016, but some are quite scuffed. We got two whole sets printed in SR2016, so will use the spare set as the primary markers in SR2017 with the SR2016 set as spares. Robot 100mm 128-131 178-181 We have badges from SR2016, so don't need new markers Token A 200mm 132-135 182-185 Token B 200mm 136-139 186-189 Token C 200mm 140 190 The Arena markers have been packaged up into 'A primary', 'B primary', 'A spare' and 'B spare' packs ready for deployment on the set-up day. The token markers for arena A and B can be found in game-markers.git (A-TOKEN* and B-TOKEN*). These have been combined into a single PDF in arena.git using the command pdfjoin -o sr2017_token_240x240.pdf /path/to/game-markers.git/SR2017/comp/*TOKEN* . This PDF contains a single sides-worth of markers, meaning that 12 copies are required to allow us to construct both a primary and spare set of tokens for each arena. The markers are to be ordered from Stormpress on 270gsm synthetic media (as specified in the README.txt file in arena.git). Before requesting a quote from Stormpress, I got someone else to sanity check the PDFs. Arena labels \u00b6 Each arena has 'A' and 'B' labels applied to the outside of the walls. We need 16 of each label (4 per wall). All of the 'A' and 'B' labels from SR2016 are suitable for use in SR2017 and have been packaged up ready for deployment on the set-up day. Game props \u00b6 The SR2017 game has 9 'token' props per arena. These tokens consist of cardboard boxes with libkoki markers attached to each face. All markers on a single token are the same, but each token has a different marker number. There are 4 tokens with marker numbers in the 'A' range, 4 tokens with marker numbers in the 'B' range and a single token with a 'C' marker. Each arena has two full sets of tokens, a primary and a spare set. The rules specify the size of each token as a cube with a side length of 245\u00b110mm. This size was chosen to match the nominal dimensions of a double wall 9 inch cardboard box. 4 packs of 10 of UKPackaging ref 15759 are to be ordered (36 boxes required). The tokens are not associated with corners/robots in any way this year, so their colouring should not imply any association. However, the tokens needs to be easily identifiable as 'A', 'B' and 'C' for linesmen and spectators. For this reason the tokens will be red (A tokens, Apple), yellow (non-fluorescent) (B tokens, Banana) and white/brown combo (C tokens, Coconut). Each token will take 3.6m of 48mm wide tape to cover all 12 edges. There are 16 A and 16 B tokens, requiring ~58m of red and ~58m of yellow tape respectively. There are 4 C tokens, requiring ~7.5m of white tape and ~7.5m of brown tape. All tape from Gaffertape.com Industrial Grade/Cloth Tape Carpet \u00b6 For the last few years we have used 'budget cord carpet' either in blue or red (depending on availability) from More For Your Floor . Previously we have ordered 2x 18x4m lengths and 1x 9x4m length, however we cut the 18m lengths in half. Since they charge per square metre, we can just order 5x 9x4m lengths for the same price and save our time cutting it up. Arena walls \u00b6 The arena walls are 300mm tall made out of 9mm thick waterproof MDF in 1.144m sections. There are 7 sections per side of the arena, giving an internal size of 7.999m (7x1.144 - 0.009). Each section has two feet that stick out on the outside of the arena. These feet have water-filled 5l plastic jerry cans placed on them for ballast. The wall sections are held together with 3.5x25mm screws (2 screws per section for a total of 56 screws). We already own all of the wall sections, all of the screws and all of the jerry cans from previous years. Network requirements \u00b6 There is a private LAN, the 'arena network', that connects all of the computers around the arenas, the shepherding area and the score entry area. This LAN requires points at: Each corner of each arena (8 off) requires two ethernet points that can reach up to 2m in the air from the floor. The shepherd area requires two ethernet points The score entry area requires two ethernet points (provide 4) The downstairs 'outside' display requires one ethernet point The upstairs 'outside' display requires one ethernet point. This will be connected to the Newbury network, it will only have internet access and not access to the rest of the arena network. This LAN connects to the Newbury network to get internet access.

Display Assembly \u00b6 Two people are required for screen assembly Materials \u00b6 Outside display floor plan (outside-display-floor-0.pdf and outside-display-floor-2.pdf from comp-floorplans.git) 10x unicol stands 10x 24\" screens with HDMI inputs (we own 6) 2x 32\" screens with HDMI inputs 8x vesa pole mounts 2x unicol mounts for 32\" screens 12x 4-way extension leads (UK plug and UK sockets) 12x raspberry pis 12x raspberry pi PSUs 12x HDMI leads A piece of cardboard to make sled for raspberry pis 1x roll of 50mm x 50m black gaffer tape Roll of address labels Pen Tools \u00b6 1x PZ2 screwdriver Set of metric hex keys Scissors or knife Procedure \u00b6 It is very important that the correct raspberry pis are attached to the correct type of screen. The name of each raspberry pi will be indicated, but may not be marked on the raspberry pi itself. If it is not marked on the raspberry pi itself, use some address labels to mark them appropriately. Assemble 8 of the unicol stands with a single pole and 2 with both poles. [30 mins] Attach the pole mounts to the back of 8 of the 24\" screens. [30 mins] Attach the 8 24\" screens to the 8 single-pole unicol stands. [30 mins] Attach the 2 unicol mounts for the 32\" screens to the 2 dual-pole unicol stands. [10 mins] Attach the 2 32\" screens to the 2 dual-pole unicol stands. [10 mins] Attach the desk stands to the remaining 2 24\" screens. [10 mins] On the back of all 12 screens attach a 4-way extension lead with gaffer tape. [30 mins] On the back of all 12 screens attach a raspberry pi with a piece of cardboard, as an insulating sled, and with gaffer tape. Observe the correct mapping and do not cover the label applied in step 1: [30 mins] Raspberry pis marked with 'arena-A' or 'arena-B' go onto the 8 24\" screens on single-pole unicol stands Raspberry pis marked with 'outside-0' or 'outside-2' go onto the 2 32\" screens Raspberry pis marked with 'shepherding' or 'staging' go onto the 2 24\" desk mount screens Plug all of the raspberry pis into their corresponding display with HDMI leads. [10 mins] Plug all of the raspberry pis into the 4-way extension lead with their PSUs. [10 mins] Plug each screen into its 4-way extension lead with the appropriate lead (supplied with the screen). [10 mins] Work with Competition Software Coordinator to test that each screen functions as expected. Note that the screen must be powered up (and the HDMI cable connected to the raspberry pi) before powering up the raspberry pi, otherwise it may not detect the screen. [30 mins] Place and plug in (both power and network) the two 'outside' displays (the ones not in the arena or staging area). Refer to the floor plans for the positions. [15 mins] Total assembly time: 4 hours 15 mins. SR2017 Game (Easy as ABC) Prop Construction \u00b6 The SR2016 game requires tokens to be constructed. These tokens consist of cardboard box cubes with 250mm side-length covered with libkoki markers. To assist human spectators, coloured gaffer tape is applied to the faces of the cube. Four people are required for token construction Materials \u00b6 Cardboard boxes - 36x 9\"x9\"x9\" double-wall boxes (external dimensions approx. 245mm x 254mm x 254mm) Token libkoki markers Double-sided finger-lift tape - 4x 12mm x 50m rolls Red cloth gaffer tape - 3x 48mm x 25m rolls Yellow cloth gaffer tape - 3x 48mm x 25m rolls White cloth gaffer tape - 1x 48mm x 25m rolls Brown cloth gaffer tape - 1x 48mm x 25m rolls Grey cloth gaffer tape - 2x 48mm x 25m rolls Tools \u00b6 Scissors Procedure \u00b6 There are two sets of tokens to be built. Those for arena A and those for arena B. To make things simple the tokens will be constructed in two phases: arena A tokens followed by arena B tokens. Each token has six of the same marker number and the orientation of the markers is irrelevant. Fold the flat-packed box into a cube. [30 sec] Use the grey tape to seal the top and bottom flaps along the seam. [30 sec] Obtain a complete set of markers (all marker numbers the same). [30 sec] Apply a cross of double-sided tape to a side of the box. Stick a marker onto the box, taking care to align it in the centre of the face. Repeat the above two steps until all of the markers have been stuck on the box. [6 mins] Get a second person to verify that all of the markers on the box have the same number (as noted in the small grey text in the bottom left of each marker). [1 min] Use the coloured tape (as specified below) to cover all 12 edges of the box and seal the marker edges. Take care to ensure that it is outside of the grey square surrounding each marker. [6 mins] Use red tape for 'A' tokens Use yellow tape for 'B' tokens Use white/brown tape for 'C' tokens (use white on some edges and brown on others - make it look coconut-y) Verify the token with the verification program again. [1 min] Repeat. Setup time: 30 mins . Construction time per token: ~16mins . Total construction time (with four people): ~3 hours . Final Day Arena Changeover \u00b6 On the final day of the competition we change to a single arena (arena A) for quarter finals, semi finals and final. There is very little time to perform this changeover between the final heat and the first quarter final. Six people are required for arena changeover (2 guards, 4 workers) Tools \u00b6 2x battery drills w. PZ2 screwdriver bits Procedure \u00b6 Instruct the two workers to stop anyone other than the four workers from entering the changeover area. The following two tasks happen in parallel (two people per task): Remove the screws joining the arena wall sections along the side of arena B next to arena A and 3 sections down each side. Take care to only remove the screws on one side of the joint (ask Rich which side). [2 mins] Remove the jerry cans from the feet of the walls being unscrewed and unplug the power and network cables from the two displays in the corners of arena B next to arena A. [2 mins] Move all of the unscrewed wall sections to the other side of arena B. [1 min] The following two tasks happen in parallel: Pull back the unused network and power cabling to the other side of arena B, taking care to leave the network and power cabling running to arena A. [1 min] Wheel the unplugged corner displays to the other side of arena B. [1 min] Reposition the crowd barrier along the exposed edge of arena A and partially along the exposed staging area.

Head Match Scorer \u00b6 Responsible for managing the marshals and score entry which they may bring in as their only subordinate roles. They should station themselves near the arena/staging area to ensure any questions with regards to scoring can be asked. Note that this role is not about making decisions related to the interpretations of the rules. That is the responsibility of the Judge . Match Marshal \u00b6 Responsible for being in the arena, saving robots and recording the end-state of matches. They may not bring in any subordinate volunteers. In this role you will be assigned an arena and work with a partner. You will be allowed to enter the arena during matches if it is deemed necessary, however it is very important that you do not obstruct any robot or its vision and leave the arena as soon as possible. Each of you will be each given a score sheet 1 on a clipboard which you must both individually fill in fully by the end of the match. Anything that happens after the match has ended must not be counted as a score and the arena must not be changed until both scorers have finished. Once a match has finished it is your responsibility to take your completed score sheet to the score entry desk which will be near the arenas and you must return promptly to the arena in case you need to be found for further scoring questions. Teams are not allowed to enter the arena to collect their robots until after scoring has finished. 1 : The score sheets currently label the pink corner as purple. This isn't a major issue because they both start with the letter P, but it's something to be aware of. As well as scoring, your responsibilities include making sure robots start in the right corner and switching off robots that do not automatically turn off after a match ends or when a team requests that you do so. You must also make sure that any arena props (tokens, for example) are in the correct place at the start of each match as detailed below. You are not responsible, however, for making sure a match starts with the correct number of teams -- that is down to the shepherds. Teams must not be allowed in the arena during a match and only one team member is allowed in the area between the crowd barrier and arena wall. It is the responsibility of the team members to place their robot in the start zone before the match starts. If a robot moves off before the match starts (aside from minor servo-resetting arm movements) teams are allowed to switch off their robot, reset it and start again. However, if the mis-started robot touches any arena prop then they are immediately disqualified. Once the robot start button has been pressed and the match has started, teams are not allowed to interact with their robots until after scoring has taken place. If the team members indicates that they wish for you to turn off their robot (i.e. \"throwing in the towel\") you may do so but by doing so they forfeit the match which will be recorded in the score sheets as a disqualification. There are two cases where you are allowed to switch off a robot yourself, one is when the match ends and the other is when a robot is causing unintentional and significant damage to another robot (i.e. mashes into another robot, pins it, stopping it from being able to function -- includes one dragging the other around if they become intertwined), and in that case it is up to you to decide which robot should be switched off but their match is not forfeited. If the damage is intentional, then the team will get forfeited (potentially for previous matched too), but this decision should be left to the judge. A checklist for robot damage is available below. You must read the rules before starting this role to make sure you understand the game, the scoring rules and how the arena is laid out. If you have any questions you may first ask the head match scorer and secondly the judge. Template Arena Setup Checklist \u00b6 Tokens in the arena aren't damaged. If they are, swap them out with the spares. The tokens in the arena are intended for that arena -- this can be established by reading the grey text printed on each marker on the token. If there is more than one arena then the markers on the sides of any tokens will have the name of the arena as part of the text in the bottom left of the marker. There must be the correct number of tokens of each type in the arena. The precise configuration depends on the game, though the per-year version of this checklist should be explicit about what's needed (and not rely on volunteers remembering the rules) Each token is placed on a suitable token starting positions that are marked out on the arena floor. Where possible these should be colour-coordinated. Robot Damage Checklist \u00b6 If the damage is intentional, seek the judge. If the damage is unintentional: If a robot mashes into another robot, but only briefly, leaving both robots free to move (including situations in which, say, one robot has a fragile, flaily arm that gets snapped off in the collision) then you must leave the robots to continue -- the teams are aware that accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable. If a robot mashes into another robot, and pins it, stopping it from being able to function (including one dragging the other around if they become intertwined) then at least one of the robots must be switched off, depending on which robot caused the damage, but the scores are not forfeited in this case. Match Score Entry \u00b6 Responsible for receiving scores from the match scorers and entering them into the competition software. They may not bring in any subordinate volunteers. In the role of score entry you will be stationed at a desk near to the arena/staging area. When a score sheet is given to you by the match scorers, you will enter the scores into a computer and then file the score sheet in a folder.

That is the responsibility of the Judge .","title":"Head Match Scorer"},{"location":"competition/matches/match-scoring/#match-marshal","text":"Responsible for being in the arena, saving robots and recording the end-state of matches. They may not bring in any subordinate volunteers. In this role you will be assigned an arena and work with a partner. You will be allowed to enter the arena during matches if it is deemed necessary, however it is very important that you do not obstruct any robot or its vision and leave the arena as soon as possible. Each of you will be each given a score sheet 1 on a clipboard which you must both individually fill in fully by the end of the match. Anything that happens after the match has ended must not be counted as a score and the arena must not be changed until both scorers have finished. Once a match has finished it is your responsibility to take your completed score sheet to the score entry desk which will be near the arenas and you must return promptly to the arena in case you need to be found for further scoring questions. Teams are not allowed to enter the arena to collect their robots until after scoring has finished. 1 : The score sheets currently label the pink corner as purple. This isn't a major issue because they both start with the letter P, but it's something to be aware of. As well as scoring, your responsibilities include making sure robots start in the right corner and switching off robots that do not automatically turn off after a match ends or when a team requests that you do so. You must also make sure that any arena props (tokens, for example) are in the correct place at the start of each match as detailed below. You are not responsible, however, for making sure a match starts with the correct number of teams -- that is down to the shepherds. Teams must not be allowed in the arena during a match and only one team member is allowed in the area between the crowd barrier and arena wall. It is the responsibility of the team members to place their robot in the start zone before the match starts. If a robot moves off before the match starts (aside from minor servo-resetting arm movements) teams are allowed to switch off their robot, reset it and start again. However, if the mis-started robot touches any arena prop then they are immediately disqualified. Once the robot start button has been pressed and the match has started, teams are not allowed to interact with their robots until after scoring has taken place. If the team members indicates that they wish for you to turn off their robot (i.e. \"throwing in the towel\") you may do so but by doing so they forfeit the match which will be recorded in the score sheets as a disqualification. There are two cases where you are allowed to switch off a robot yourself, one is when the match ends and the other is when a robot is causing unintentional and significant damage to another robot (i.e. mashes into another robot, pins it, stopping it from being able to function -- includes one dragging the other around if they become intertwined), and in that case it is up to you to decide which robot should be switched off but their match is not forfeited. If the damage is intentional, then the team will get forfeited (potentially for previous matched too), but this decision should be left to the judge. A checklist for robot damage is available below. You must read the rules before starting this role to make sure you understand the game, the scoring rules and how the arena is laid out. If you have any questions you may first ask the head match scorer and secondly the judge.","title":"Match Marshal"},{"location":"competition/matches/match-scoring/#template-arena-setup-checklist","text":"Tokens in the arena aren't damaged. If they are, swap them out with the spares. The tokens in the arena are intended for that arena -- this can be established by reading the grey text printed on each marker on the token. If there is more than one arena then the markers on the sides of any tokens will have the name of the arena as part of the text in the bottom left of the marker. There must be the correct number of tokens of each type in the arena. The precise configuration depends on the game, though the per-year version of this checklist should be explicit about what's needed (and not rely on volunteers remembering the rules) Each token is placed on a suitable token starting positions that are marked out on the arena floor. Where possible these should be colour-coordinated.","title":"Template Arena Setup Checklist"},{"location":"competition/matches/match-scoring/#robot-damage-checklist","text":"If the damage is intentional, seek the judge.

If a robot mashes into another robot, and pins it, stopping it from being able to function (including one dragging the other around if they become intertwined) then at least one of the robots must be switched off, depending on which robot caused the damage, but the scores are not forfeited in this case.","title":"Robot Damage Checklist"},{"location":"competition/matches/match-scoring/#match-score-entry","text":"Responsible for receiving scores from the match scorers and entering them into the competition software.

Roles \u00b6 Here is a description of the roles related to shepherding. Head Shepherd \u00b6 Responsible for managing the shepherds which they may bring in as their only subordinate role. Check and report volunteer arrival. Assign volunteers to roles. Brief volunteers. Supervise shepherds and adjust shepherding procedures where necessary. Shepherd \u00b6 Responsible for finding teams and ensuring they make it to their matches. They report to the Head Shepherd and may not create further subordinate roles. Below is a description of the various tasks shepherds might be assigned to. You will receive your assignment to one of the roles from the Head Shepherd. At different stages of the competition (inital matches or finals) additional temporary tasks will be necessary. Team shepherds \u00b6 Each team shepherd is responsible for notifying teams in their zone when it is time to move to the staging area. They will be notified via radio by the timekeeper when it is time to do so (note that this time may vary by zone, meaning shepherds responsible for zones further away from the arena might be told to fetch earlier). Each team shepherd is assigned a colour and is responsible for all teams whose bays are in the zone of the same colour as shown in the shepherding layout map. Furthermore, they will receive a printout of the match schedule which will show which teams need to be fetched for which match with teams under their responsibility coloured in in the respective colour. We ask that shepherds notify the head shepherd immediately if they find any changes/errors in layout or colouring of their match schedule. Once a shepherd has been told to fetch all teams under their responsibility for a certain match, they have to make sure each team is told within 2 minutes to give teams enough time to make their way to the staging area. For matches where a particular shepherd has to fetch many teams (more than 4 generally) we recommend starting the process a bit earlier. The shepherd can request from the timekeeper via radio to get the fetching signal a bit earlier in this case if they would find this helpful. Note that the main responsibility of the shepherds is to notify all teams who are at their desk within two minutes of being told so. If after this there is time left, the may look for missing teams etc but need to make sure to be ready to fetch for the next round in time. Timekeeper \u00b6 The responsibility of the timekeeper is to be aware of the schedule and assist the shepherds in the other roles. More specifically, they should watch the shepherding app and notify the team shepherds via radio when it is time for them to fetch their teams. The timekeeper should also notify the other shepherds of any updates or changes of schedule. If it seems like the timing does not work out (teams waiting for a long time for staging or teams arriving too late for staging) the timekeeper should discuss an update of the fetching schedule with the head shepherd. Guard \u00b6 The responsibility of the guard is to open and close the staging area at appropriate times and control entry to this area. More specifically the guard should not allow anyone into the staging area unless they are a blueshirt or staging for the next match. Only one person from each team is allowed in the staging area and they must wear a high-vis vest showing their team name, indicating that they have passed the safety test. When letting a team (=person with robot) into the staging area the guard should tell them which corner they will stage for, ideally mentioning the colour and approximate location of the staging desk if possible. We recommend that the guard keeps a record of which teams have already been admitted for a particular match. In previous years, the guard would also tell the timekeeper when a match was fully staged so that this information could be relayed to the team shepherds. If the guard sees a team leaving the staging area with robot markers still attached to their robot, she should request that the team return the markers before leaving the staging area. Badgers \u00b6 The responsibility of the badgers is to supervise the staging as well as to hand out and return robot badges and USB-keys. More specifically, the badgers should make sure that teams follow the direction of travel through the staging area as indicated by the arrows on the floor. When staging, the badgers should help to guide the teams to the correct staging bay. The badgers then hand out the robot badges and match keys to the teams, making sure that a team has staged in the correct slot and is receiving the correct badges. When destaging after a match, the badgers need to make sure that the teams coming from the staging desks into the arena travel the right way round, not obstructing the destaging. The teams leaving the arena should be advised to place their robots on the destaging desks for badge and USB key removal. The badgers need to collect the badges and keys and sort them, ready to be handed out in the next round of staging. The badgers need to ensure that teams do not leave the staging area with markers or USB-keys. The badgers should also clear any items left on the staging tables at this point to prepare for the next round of staging.","title":"Shepherding"},{"location":"competition/matches/shepherding/#shepherding","text":"Anything related to shepherding goes here.","title":"Shepherding"},{"location":"competition/matches/shepherding/#roles","text":"Here is a description of the roles related to shepherding.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"competition/matches/shepherding/#head-shepherd","text":"Responsible for managing the shepherds which they may bring in as their only subordinate role.

[10 mins] Stick the printed TLA sheets to both sides of the card. [20 mins] Tape each piece of card to the end of a bamboo cane. [30 mins] Total construction time: 1 hour. Pit Construction \u00b6 Three people are required for Pit Construction Materials \u00b6 Pit layout floor plan (pits-floor-0.pdf and pits-floor-2.pdf from comp-floorplans.git) 12x 48mm x 50m rolls of masking tape 54x large trestle tables 324x chairs 54x fully assembled flags (from Flag Construction) - These can be constructed while the pit construction is happening. 1x roll of 50mm x 50m white gaffer tape 54x pit information sheets TODO who is making these? Tools \u00b6 1x 30m measuring tape Procedure \u00b6 On floor 0, mark out the corners of all of the pits with small squares of masking tape. [30 mins] Double check the location of the corner marking tape - we don't get a second chance at laying the boundaries so it's worth checking. [20 mins] Lay the full length boundaries using the masking tape. There is only enough tape for a single strip of tape between pits so do not run two pieces of tape next to each other anywhere. [30 mins] Place the tables as shown on the floor plan. [10 mins] Attach the pit flags onto the corner of each table using the white gaffer tape, observing the mapping shown on the floor plan. Orient the flags so that it is easy to read them when standing near the door to the lift. [1 hour] Tape a pit information sheet to each desk using the white gaffer tape. [20 mins] On floor 2, mark out the corners of all of the pits with small squares of masking tape. [1 hour] Double check the location of the corner marking tape. [40 mins] Lay the full length boundaries using the masking tape. As on floor 0 there is only enough for a single strip of tape between pits. [1 hour] Place the tables as shown on the floor plan.

Any doubts must be discussed with Rich Barlow ASAP. Safety \u00b6 The biggest risk of damage or injury is from the banana plugs coming unplugged from the charger. These are the red and black plugs that go into the side of the charger. All of the chargers should have the cables cable-tied to the charger to make it difficult to remove these plugs. Under no circumstances should these red and black plugs be unplugged from the chargers. The batteries themselves have many built in safety features and, unless severely abused, are completely safe. All batteries undergoing charging must be placed inside a fireproof charging bag. In the extremely unlikely event of a fire due to a battery DO NOT attempt to tackle the fire - the batteries contain a flammable metal (Lithium) which cannot be safely tackled with most fire extinguishers. If at any point you have any doubts about safety, immediately summon the Competition Team Support Coordinator (Rich Barlow) and the Health & Safety Coordinator (Scarzy) via Helpdesk . Procedures \u00b6 Swapping a team's battery \u00b6 Teams will bring discharged batteries to the Battery Charging station and require a replacement charged battery. A Battery Charging volunteer should receive the discharged battery from the team and place it in the discharged battery box. A charged battery should be removed from the charged battery box and handed to the team. Do not allow teams to take batteries from the box themselves - we want to prevent teams from hoarding batteries. Charging a discharged battery \u00b6 All of the battery chargers will be set-up and ready to use. Before a battery is connected the screen must display LiPo BALANCE 2.2A 11.1V(3S) . If it displays anything else then please do not use it and ask Helpdesk to summon Rich Barlow. Batteries are charged as follows: Check that the battery is not physically damaged. There should be no splits or tears in the body of the battery, no nicks in the wire insulation, no exposed wire and the battery should not be so swollen that it is no longer squidgy. There will be a couple of example batteries at the Battery Charging station to compare to. If the battery is damaged, tape over the yellow XT60 connector with red tape and place it in the damaged battery box. If the battery is not damaged, plug the yellow XT60 connector into the charger cable and the white balance connector into the 4-pin socket on the side of the charger. Place the battery in the charging bag next to the charger. Hold down the Start/Enter button for about 3 seconds until the screen displays R:3SER S:3SER CONFIRM(ENTER) . If both numbers are not 3 then disconnect the battery and summon Rich Barlow via Helpdesk. If the display is as expected, press Start/Enter to commence charging. After about 1 hour the battery should complete charging - the screen will display a charge complete message. Simply disconnect the battery from the charger and place it in the charged battery box. If at any point throughout the charging cycle the charger indicates an issue (e.g. a timeout, capacity or cable error), disconnect the battery from the charger, apply a piece of red tape to the yellow XT60 connector on the battery and place it in the damaged battery box. Inevitably there will be a small number of faulty chargers. If you suspect that a particular charger is faulty (lots of batteries fail to charge on it), disconnect it from its power supply, apply red tape to its XT60 connector and place it in the damaged battery box.","title":"Battery Charging"},{"location":"competition/team-support/battery-charging/#battery-charging","text":"We (Student Robotics) manage the charging of all batteries at the competition.

Volunteers are expected to advise teams in a similar fashion to mentoring - that is they should not tell teams what to do, but offer advice and guidance. The volunteers also help with kit related issues that may or may not be caused by a problem with the kit. It is the responsibility of the Helpdesk volunteers to assess teams' problems and, if necessary, swap out bits of kit hardware. In some situations teams may need to be put in contact with a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help diagnose and fix issues.

Procedures \u00b6 Almost all of Helpdesk's operations are covered by the following procedures. Handling of all requests \u00b6 Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue a Helpdesk Volunteer must fill in their TLA and a single-sentence description of the issue on an Issue Form. When the issue has been resolved a single sentence description of the resolution must be written on the form. This is primarily for analytical purposes so that we can improve the operation of Helpdesk in future years. Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue that cannot be solved instantly their TLA and a very brief (couple of words) summary of the problem must be written on a post-it note and stuck up on a board of current issues. This ensures that no problems get dropped while they are being investigated. When the issue is resolved the post-it note can be thrown away. If it appears that a particular post-it has remained on the board for an extended period of time and there has been no obvious activity to resolve the issue then a volunteer should be dispatched to the team to see if it's still a problem. Handling of requests for robot safety checks \u00b6 The robots require safety checking before they are allowed to compete in the competition. Teams will not be given their hi-viz vest until their robot has passed the safety check procedure. Helpdesk volunteers should direct teams enquiring about safety checks to the Health & Safety Coordinator (Scarzy). Handling of general robot development requests \u00b6 Many teams will come to Helpdesk requesting help with the development of their robot or, more likely, help using the Student Robotics kit and associated software. As mentioned earlier, Helpdesk volunteers are not expected to tell teams what to do, but rather offer advice. Helpdesk volunteers should strive to answer questions about the use of the kit and software. Some queries may require a volunteer to visit the team in their pit to observe behaviour in situ. This must only be done by a Helpdesk volunteer if it will leave no fewer than two volunteers actively manning Helpdesk. If it is not possible for a Helpdesk volunteer to visit a team then a Roving Helper should be summoned, via radio if necessary. In some rare situations it may be necessary to request the assistance of a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help solve an issue. This should only be done if the issue is non-trivial. The following people are available for specific help and can be summoned over the radio: Electronic Hardware Rich Barlow Rob Spanton IDE Peter Law Python API Peter Law Rich Barlow Rob Spanton Handling suspected damaged kit requests \u00b6 If a team comes to Helpdesk with a suspicion of some of the Student Robotics kit being damaged then the following procedure should be followed: Request that the team take a freshly charged battery and see if the problem persists. Request that the team tries swapping the USB and power cables to the device in question, where applicable. If the kit contains multiple of the device in question (e.g. USB hub, motor board), request that the team tries swapping it with the other one in the kit. Request that the team tests the device in question with a very simple code project that only attempts to control that one device. If all previous steps indicate that the device is probably faulty then continue with the kit swap procedure. Swapping out kit \u00b6 After determining that a piece of kit is most likely faulty it must be swapped with a working spare. Helpdesk has a supply of spare kit. To swap a piece of kit please fill in a Kit Swap Form and follow the instructions on there. Since there is a limited quantity of spare kit, all attempts must be made to verify that the issue being observed is not caused by something else. Handling requests for batteries/chargers/bags on Saturday evening \u00b6 Some teams may wish to work on their robot on Saturday night and will therefore require batteries, a charger, a charger PSU and a battery bag. If a team requests these items, note down their TLA and the part codes of the five items on the 'Saturday Evening Battery/Charger Loans' sheet and give them the parts. On Sunday morning one helpdesk volunteer must ensure that all of the parts listed on this sheet are collected from the teams and returned to the battery charging station. Handling requests for batteries/chargers/bags on Sunday evening \u00b6 Some teams have been granted permission to keep the kit for a little while after the competition. To be able to make use of the kit they will require batteries and stuff. They MUST NOT be given any of these items from helpdesk. They will receive these items at the 'Kit Return Desk' downstairs when they leave. All teams must go to the Kit Return Desk, regardless of whether they are returning their kit or not as that is where teams keeping kit will receive their batteries and stuff. Handling requests for velcro \u00b6 Teams may request a piece of velcro to use on their robot for the purpose of attaching the robot badges. As we have a limited supply of velcro, please follow the instructions on the velcro measurements/instruction sheet. Make sure that you cross off their TLA once they have a piece of velcro so that they can't keep coming back for more. Handling requests for sample robot badge \u00b6 The robots have 'robot badges' on them during competition matches. A team may ask for a sample badge to check for size. Helpdesk has a single sample badge to lend out to teams. Teams MUST return this badge to helpdesk ASAP. When handing it out take note of the team's TLA and chase them up if they haven't returned it in 5 mins. Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Based on issues handled in previous years, the following may be helpful: Key phrase Resolution \"Failed to dequeue buffer Assertion 'frame != ((void*0)' failed\" There was a problem with the webcam. Make sure it's plugged in. Make sure the webcam is plugged directly into the brain board (not via a USB hub). If the problem keeps occurring, try swapping out the webcam (following the procedure). Need to initialise servos to non-zero position Use 'Custom Robot Object Initialisation' and set position between .init() and .wait_start() . (On 'Programming->sr' page of docs near the bottom) How to access starting corner/zone number in code Use 'R.zone' (On 'Programming->sr' page of docs in the 'Other Robot Attributes' section) Worried about token/marker offset of 100 in competition mode We handle this automatically, they do not need to worry. If their code works in development mode with development markers, it will work in competition mode with competition markers. They must ensure that they plug the arena/competition key provided to them in the staging area into their robot before they turn the power on. Any issues with tablets/charging of tablets Remind teams that they can access the robot interface on any WiFi enabled defined, i.e. a laptop, phone or tablet of their own. Direct them to the 'Kits->WiFi' page in the docs. If they really want to use the tablet and the battery is knackered, swap it out (following the procedure).","title":"Helpdesk"},{"location":"competition/team-support/helpdesk/#helpdesk","text":"Helpdesk is the teams' primary source of support.

This is primarily for analytical purposes so that we can improve the operation of Helpdesk in future years. Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue that cannot be solved instantly their TLA and a very brief (couple of words) summary of the problem must be written on a post-it note and stuck up on a board of current issues. This ensures that no problems get dropped while they are being investigated. When the issue is resolved the post-it note can be thrown away. If it appears that a particular post-it has remained on the board for an extended period of time and there has been no obvious activity to resolve the issue then a volunteer should be dispatched to the team to see if it's still a problem.","title":"Handling of all requests"},{"location":"competition/team-support/helpdesk/#handling-of-requests-for-robot-safety-checks","text":"The robots require safety checking before they are allowed to compete in the competition.

This must only be done by a Helpdesk volunteer if it will leave no fewer than two volunteers actively manning Helpdesk. If it is not possible for a Helpdesk volunteer to visit a team then a Roving Helper should be summoned, via radio if necessary. In some rare situations it may be necessary to request the assistance of a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help solve an issue. This should only be done if the issue is non-trivial.

The schedule (on the website; see above link) defines when league matches will be for your team. You are responsible for bringing your robot to the arena, and taking part in the match: You must arrive at the competition staging area (next to the arenas, see map) with your robot at least 2 minutes before your match starts. Only your designated \u201crobot wrangler\u201d may enter the staging area. They must be wearing a high vis jacket identifying your team. You will receive this jacket once your robot has been checked to be compliant with the regulations in the rules. In the staging area, a special USB flash disk will be present to tell the robot which corner it starts in. You will need to insert this into your robot before powering on. Robot wranglers should turn your robot on before it enters the arena, so that it is ready to start on time. The match will begin regardless of whether your robot is ready. Robots are started by the team member pressing the start button on the power board. Once pressed, the team member should step back to the edge of the crowd barrier.

Any parts found to be defective are to be repaired or disposed of before the Kit Packing Event. The Kit Packing Event is a two day weekend event that occurs at the end of August/start of September. The sorted and tested parts from the Kit Collation Event are packed into kits ready for handing to teams. The consumable parts of the kit are also prepared and packed, such as the wire and camcon connectors. At the end of the week all of the kits are strapped to a pallet ready to be shipped to our post handling provider.","title":"Maintenance"},{"location":"kit/hardware/kit-collation/","text":"Kit Collation \u00b6 The purpose of Kit Collation is to gather together all kit parts from the previous Competition Programme year, test them and store them ready for packing at the Kit Packing Event. See SR2017 Kit Collation Plan for a detailed plan. See SR2018 Kit Collation Plan for a details of the upcoming KCE. Process \u00b6 Each kit must go through the following process. Once the CHECKIN task has been performed for a given kit the remaining tasks can be run in parallel - especially the testing of different parts. The sequence of tasks is the same for all parts, however the specific requirements vary depending upon the part. CHECKIN - Unpack each kit and scan its contents into a single location in the Inventory. Any kit expected back from teams but not found is marked as missing. VISUAL - Visually inspect each part for damage. CLEAN - Clean each part. TEST - Test each part, where possible. CHECKOUT - Pack parts of the same type into boxes and update the Inventory. CHASEUP - [after event] Chase up missing parts. Throughout the process the state of each part is tracked through two fields: functional_condition (currently condition for backwards compatibility) and physical_condition . The functional_condition field has a value of either unknown , broken or working and is set based upon the outcome of the testing procedure carried out in the TEST task. The physical_condition field has one of the same three values that the functional_condition field can have, but it is set based upon a visual inspection of the part during the VISUAL task. We will only ship parts that have both a functional_condition and physical_condition of working . After the Kit Collation Event any parts with either a functional_condition or physical_condition of broken will be assessed to see whether they can be repaired or need to be replaced. CHECKIN \u00b6 Tools: Laptop, barcode/QR scanner Duration: 1 person day Remove each part from the kit box and move it into a checked-in directory in the Inventory. There is no need to worry about keeping track of which team the part came from, as this information can be retrieved from the Inventory at a later date if required. Mark each part as having functional_condition: unknown and physical_condition: unknown . If the Inventory shows any parts remaining in the kit box after all of the parts have been physically removed move them into a missing directory. VISUAL \u00b6 Tools: Laptop, barcode/QR scanner, label printer Duration: 2 person days Inspect parts for visible physical damage - mild cosmetic damage is not a concern. Also apply a new asset sticker if the current one is damaged or illegible. See the following table for example of visible physical damage for each part. Note that a case is considered to be damaged if a panel is cracked entirely in half (or close to it) or if a piece has broken off such that the board can be touched. Once the physical condition of the part has been assessed, update its physical_condition field to either working or broken . If it is broken, add a short description of the issue. Part Examples of physical damage Power board cuts, nicks or exposed copper on wires; large heatshrink slipping off of XT 60; loose screw terminal; case cracked/broken/missing screws; charring on board; connectors broken/full of stuff Motor board case cracked/broken, charring on board, connectors broken/full of stuff, button held down (try pressing the button - it should click) Servo board case cracked/broken, charring on board, blackened pins, connectors broken/full of stuff Ruggeduino case cracked/broken/missing screws, charring on board, connectors broken/full of stuff Screw shields bent pins, chewed up screw heads Odroid case cracked/broken, case hinge broken (try pulling apart at hinge end), connectors broken/full of stuff Tablet cracked screen USB charger bent pins, cracked case USB hub cracked case, damaged connector, loose parts rattling around inside WiFi dongle cracked case, damaged connector Webcam cracked case, damaged cable, damaged connector (missing stand is OK) Battery charger cracked case, damaged wires, large heatshrink slipping off of XT 60, missing cable tie, missing buttons Battery charger supply cracked case, damaged strain relief Battery bag torn stitching Battery Damaged wires, swollen to the point of being hard (squidgy is OK) Some parts are not tracked in the Inventory, but still require visual inspection. If any of these parts fail they should be thrown in the bin: Part Example of visible damage USB memory stick Micro USB cable Full-size USB cable Odroid power cable Screwdriver CLEAN \u00b6 Tools: Bowl, J cloths, washing up liquid, IPA, label residue remover Duration: 2 person days Using wringed-out cloth, give each part a wipe with soapy water. If it has adhesive residue, wipe it with label residue remover and then soapy water once the reside has been removed. For removal of grease and pen marks wipe it with IPA.

There is roughly a month between the two events to allow for repairs to be made and replacement parts purchased. At the end of Kit Packing the kits are loaded onto a pallet and shipped to our post handling provider. The kits will later be forwarded to the various Kickstart locations once the number of teams at each location has been confirmed. Process \u00b6 Before kits can be packed, there is some preparation work that must be done. Each of these tasks can be performed in parallel. WIRE - The wire must be cut to length. CAMCON - The camcon connectors must be counted out and bagged. LAYOUT - Boxes of each type of part must be laid out around the room. Once the preparation tasks have been completed the packing can commence. The process is strictly sequential for each kit, but multiple kits may be flowing through the process simultaneously. FILL - Fill a kit box with the parts. SCAN - Scan and move all of the tracked parts into the box in the Inventory. CHECK - Perform a check of the box contents and check off everything on a check list. JIFFY - Pack the box contents into Jiffy bags. PACK - Pack the Jiffy bags and remaining parts into the box with scrunched up paper. PALLET - Once all kits have been packed they can be loaded onto a pallet. WIRE \u00b6 Each kit contains 3 lengths of thick (1mm\u00b2) wire and 4 lengths of thin (0.5mm\u00b2) wire. Since the wire is purchased on 100m reels it needs to be cut to length and folded/knotted ready for packing. The wire needs to be cut into the following: 1.8m lengths of 1mm\u00b2 wire (red, black and blue) 3m lengths of 0.5mm\u00b2 wire (red, black, blue and yellow) After being cut the wires should be folded and knotted. A demonstration on how to do this will be given at the event. CAMCON \u00b6 Each kit contains various 'Camcon' pluggable terminal block connectors. These must be counted/weighed out and bagged up. Fill resealable plastic bags with the following: 10x 7.5mm camcons 7x 5mm camcons 1x 3.81mm camcon LAYOUT \u00b6 To help with the filling of kits, boxes of each constituent part should be placed around the room such that one can easily walk around filling a kit box without missing a part. All parts should be laid out, including the wire and camcons, in 'part stations'. See the canonical kit list for reference. Each part station must have a sign by it indicating the quantity to be packed. See the kit list for these quantities. Some parts are designated for development use only and should not be shipped to teams. Since the parts processed at the Kit Collation Event are a mix of development and non-development the development ones need to be filtered out from the part stations. The following types of part have some designated for development and they must be removed before commencing the FILL task: Power Board: Development have red PCBs Servo Board: Development have red PCBs Motor Board: Development have red PCBs USB Hub: Development have a sticker on them stating so FILL \u00b6 Once all preparation steps have been completed the kit boxes can be filled with parts. Take an empty Really Useful Box and traverse the room, placing parts in the box as you go. Each station will have a sign indicating the quantity to be placed in the box. SCAN \u00b6 Once a box has been filled with all kit parts the parts that are tracked in the Inventory must be scanned to check that they are marked as working (both functionally and physically) and are not development parts. If all of the parts are valid then they should all be moved into the Really Useful Box in the Inventory. Once all of the tracked parts have been moved, the box should be physically marked to indicate it has completed the SCAN task (stick a piece of coloured tape on it). CHECK \u00b6 After the tracked parts have been moved in the Inventory the box contents should be verified and checked off on a check list . Ideally this task would be performed by a different person to the one who filled it and the one who moved it in the Inventory - to reduce the likelihood of systematic errors. Once the check list is complete it must be left in the box. JIFFY \u00b6 A checked kit (one that has a completed check list in it) is ready to have its parts safely wrapped for transport. This is done by putting the vulnerable parts of the kit into Jiffy bags. There are two sizes of Jiffy bags: small brown ones and large white ones. Place the following parts into the specified bags and do NOT seal them. Place the filled bags back into the box. Small brown: 2x motor boards, 1x ruggeduino Small brown: 1x power board, 1x servo board, 2x WiFi dongles, 1x USB stick Small brown: 2x USB hubs, 1x Odroid Large white: 1x tablet Large white: 1x battery charger Large white: 1x battery charger PSU, 1x webcam, 1x tablet charger PACK \u00b6 To prevent the Jiffy bags and remaining parts from moving around too much in transit the empty space needs to be filled. This is done by tearing off a few metres of brown paper from a roll and scrunching it up. Some scrunched paper should be placed at the bottom of the box. The parts should be placed on top of this and finally a layer of scrunched paper should be placed on the top. The lid should be secured with two cable ties through the lids/handles in diagonally opposite corners. PALLET \u00b6 The final task, once all kits have been packed, is to load them onto a wooden pallet. The pallet will then be shipped to our post handling provider, who will forward them onto Kickstart venues at our instruction. A standard pallet is 1.2x1.0m and the load can generally be up to 2m high (what is known as a 'full' pallet). The kit boxes should be stacked on the pallet in layers of 6 (2x3). They are 0.2m high so 54 kits results in a load height of 1.8m. When all of the kits have been stacked they must be strapped to the pallet using polypropylene strapping and finally the whole assembly wrapped in stretch wrap.","title":"Kit Packing"},{"location":"kit/hardware/kit-packing/#kit-packing","text":"The purpose Kit Packing is to take the tested parts from the Kit Collation Event and pack them into kits ready for use by teams.

Purpose \u00b6 The role of the LSM is to maintain the operation of the legacy server inherited by Student Robotics prior to the formation of the CIO. The legacy server is defined as the Linode server known as 'saffron'. This machine currently hosts a selection of services, the management of which fall under multiple roles in the CIO organisational structure. Due to the multiplicity of the legacy server, it is desired for it to be retired and replaced with a system that allows for running of services managed by separate roles to be fully independent of one another. Since there is the intention to ultimately retire the legacy server, this role has an inherently finite lifetime. Once the server has been retired this role will cease to exist.

Overview of Role \u00b6 As game design coordinator, it is your responsibility to ensure that we end up with a suitable game design for the Student Robotics Competition Programme. As you will find in the ops manual, your responsibilities are: Designing the game. Producing publishable rules for the game well in advance of Kickstart. Ensuring that the details of the game are not publicly available until Kickstart. Updating the published rules throughout the year in response to rule clarification requests. Game Selection Process \u00b6 This game selection process is currently in draft-form within the ops manual. Please do ask for a copy of this draft version, as it provides a good overview of the intended process. In short, the new process is intended to allow volunteers to submit game ideas, whilst ensuring that it is an enjoyable process for all involved. It consists of the following stages: \"Informal discussions\". \"Proposals\", in which people may submit descriptions of their game ideas to you. \"Feedback\", in which volunteers have the opportunity to read proposals, and comment once on their strengths and weaknesses. \"Selection\", in which you gather responses to criticisms from game proposal authors (after appropriately filtering and collating them), and then select a game based upon the proposals, feedback and responses. You should also consult the Kit Coordinator regarding the technical appropriateness of each proposal. \"Revision\", in which you develop the final game rules, working together with the volunteer who submitted the game proposal (if they wish to participate!). Rules Structure \u00b6 In previous years, the rules have consisted of several sections. We are considering breaking these apart into separate documents (or web pages), to reduce the potentially overwhelming nature of the rulebook. The resulting documents would be: Game rules, describing what the game itself is, how scoring works, as well as how each match runs. Regulations, detailing all technical requirements that robots must adhere to in order to compete. Specifications that describe the layout of the arena, and props within it. Awards. Kit return (Which parts of the kit will be returned).

We would, of course, appreciate your feedback on your experience of the competition as we are always striving to make Student Robotics as good as it possibly can be. Write to the organisation associated with teams who dropped out without notifying SR in advance. \u00b6 Example of email sent to non-informed dropout teams in 2017: Dear Head Teacher, I am sorry to have to bring this to your attention but we felt it was important to inform you that a member of your staff entered a team in this year\u2019s Student Robotics programme and was duly assigned a place and provided with a kit and the associated support. However, they did not inform us that they were intending to drop out and not compete at this year\u2019s competition in April 2017. Moreover, despite numerous reminders and contact being attempted to ensure prompt return of their kit, they are still in possession of the SR kit nearly three months after the competition. We do appreciate that sometimes things do not go to plan and despite one\u2019s best efforts, it is not possible to progress with the Student Robotics programme, by either failing to get a team together or making progress with building the robot. In such situations, we do understand when teams inform us and explain their predicament and if we can, we suggest ways of working around the problems with more support or input. If a team is unable to continue and sadly needs to drop out, depending on the stage at which this occurs, we sometimes try to get the kit back from them so that we can pass it on to another team who will benefit from the kit and experience. If it\u2019s too late to do this then we will update our systems so that we are not expecting you on the day of the competition and make a note to contact you regarding kit return in due course. However, in your case, as your member of staff (the Team Leader) did not alert us to the fact their team were dropping out this meant that another team (and we had a waiting list of teams who were desperate to get their hands on a kit) were denied the chance to benefit from the various skills and experience that participating in Student Robotics provides and the opportunity to compete in this year\u2019s competition. Moreover, our volunteers have wasted their time by trying to contact and engage you when they could have spent time helping teams who were actually participating. As I mentioned before, the discourtesy continues by how our repeated contact to chase your member of staff to return the SR kit to us has been ignored. They are in receipt of a shipping pack with instructions of how to return the kit to us but we have still not received it, to date. I\u2019m sure that you would agree that this is not acceptable behaviour and does not set a good example to your students. We have made a note that your organisation\u2019s team dropped out without informing anyone and this will impact on any applications to enter Student Robotics in future years. As a charity which was set up to benefit as many young people as possible we just cannot afford the negative impacts of teams, such as yours, who do not value the opportunity given to them. Although we appreciate that there are many pressures on teachers, we have been saddened by the lack of courtesy extended to us throughout this process. Please ensure that the SR kit is returned to us urgently. Feedback \u00b6 The Team Coordinator should seek feedback from the Team Leaders, LTCs and Mentors on their experiences and consider updating and refining processes. In addition, the Team Coordinator should also reflect on own processes and update and refine as appropriate. The Team Coordinator should liaise with relevant members of the SR team to improve processes.

Please do not post sensitive personal information on the forum as this is publically accessible.

Your TLA is: Each team has been allocated a Local Team Co-ordinator (LTC) based roughly on your geographical location. Your LTC will be your main point of contact guiding you through the SR Programme. (If you\u2019ve competed before, you may notice that we have reorganised the way in which we provide support/communication.) Your LTC is: We are aware that you are all extremely busy people and there is often a great deal of work involved in the logistics of organising a team to enter. Therefore we will endeavour to notify you of information as soon as it is feasibly possible. However, please do bear in mind that Student Robotics is a volunteer-run organisation and, as such, the work is done in people\u2019s spare time leading to some delays occasionally, during which we would appreciate your patience. If you have any queries from now on, please do the following: 1. Look on the website. 2. Post on the forum (once you\u2019ve received your SR user account information) NB. Please do not post sensitive personal information on the forum as this is publically accessible. The forum is a great way to share information and get answers to your questions - if you\u2019re wondering about something, chances are someone else is too or has done and posted on the forum \u2013 you\u2019ll hear more about this resource at Kickstart. 3. Email your Local Team Coordinator. 4. Ask your Mentor \u2013 this is something your LTC can help with organising. (Ideally all teams would have a Mentor to help with the technical aspects of the Programme. We have a limited number of volunteers who are available to mentor teams, but if there\u2019s not one near to you, we can help support you to find your own from local industry etc.) 5. If after all that your query still has not been answered email me, Fiona at teams@studentrobotics.org . We\u2019re very excited to have your team participating in this year\u2019s competition and look forward to hopefully seeing you and your team at Kickstart in October!","title":"Example of email sent in 2017"},{"location":"teams/competition-preparation/","text":"Tickets \u00b6 Liaise with Competition Coordinator about ticket allocation process for teams.
